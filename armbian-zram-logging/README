NOTE:
The armbian-release file under the configs directory should be edited to match your config. Mine assumes you're using a sheevaplug... Also note that your kernel must be built with zram support. Otherwise, you will need to build and install the zram module, or recompile your kernel with zram support. On Debian-kirkwood devices, you should be able to add the zswap.enabled=1 kernel option to the bootargs_console variable in u-boot, then add zram to /etc/modules, to achieve this.

All but the install.sh script is copied directly from the Armbian build tree, and is therefore GPLv2 licensed, like the rest of the scripts within this repository.

Config files for armbian-zram-config and armbian-ramlog are stored in /etc/default. Do not edit variables directly in the scripts!
