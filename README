A collection of random scripts I use while managing embedded Linux systems.

These are mostly for Debian Jessie and newer; if otherwise it'll be noted.

These scripts are provided with no warranty or any implied support. Use at your own risk! These may not be tested, or may be for specific use-cases not applicable elsewhere.
