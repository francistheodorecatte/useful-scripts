Guide for running the Biamp Tesira Software (a .NET Windows app) under Linux using Wine.

Using Xubuntu 18.04/GalliumOS3.0, Wine 4.16-staging, and winetricks-master.

Tested on the Tesira Software version 3.12.

Instructions are as follows--
Add the i386 architecture to apt:
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386

Remove any old package versions of wine or winetricks:
sudo apt remove --purge wine*

Add the following repositories:
sudo add-apt-repository https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/
wget -qO - https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/winehq.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cybermax-dexter/sdl2-backport

Then run:
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

Install winehq-staging:
sudo apt install --install-recommends winehq-staging

Then install the latest winetricks release from their github, following their instructions:
https://github.com/Winetricks/winetricks

Now setup a 32bit wine prefix:
export WINEARCH=win32 WINEPREFIX=~/.wine32

To make this permanent, run this command:
echo "export WINEARCH=win32 WINEPREFIX=~/.wine32" >> ~/.bashrc

And run winetricks to install some necessary libraries:
winetricks dotnet48 corefonts gdiplus

Then you can use wine to install Tesira:
wine tesira-software-v3-12.exe

With the tesira software now installed, it should start and work pretty flawlessly.

There's just one remaining issue, where the titlebar is rendered twice. Once by the Tesira Software exe, and then a second time by Wine itself. They overlap only a little bit, and on small screens wastes a lot of screen realestate (which is already at a premium with this program.) This is easily fixed, however.

Run winecfg, and under the 'Applications' tab, click 'Add application' and browse to Tesira.exe. Once selected browse over to the 'Graphics' tab and uncheck 'Allow the window manager to decorate the windows'. Hit Apply and exit winecfg. Next time you run the Tesira Software, only Tesira titlebar will render.

If you run into any other issues, DM me on github @phineasthecat.

Cheers!
