Guide for running the Biamp Tesira Software (a .NET Windows app) under Linux using Wine.

Using Xubuntu 18.04/GalliumOS3.0, Wine 4.16-staging, and winetricks-master.

Tested on the Tesira Software version 3.12.

Instructions are as follows--
Add the i386 architecture to apt:
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386

Remove any old package versions of wine or winetricks:
sudo apt remove --purge wine*

Add the following repositories:
sudo add-apt-repository https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/
sudo add-apt-repository https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Emulators:/Wine:/Debian/xUbuntu_18.04/ ./
wget -qO - https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/Release.key | sudo apt-key add -
wget -qO - https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Emulators:/Wine:/Debian/xUbuntu_18.04/Release.key | sudo apt-key add -

Then run:
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

Install winehq-staging:
sudo apt install --install-recommends winehq-staging

Then install the latest winetricks release from their github, following their instructions:
https://github.com/Winetricks/winetricks

Now setup a 32bit wine prefix:
export WINEARCH=win32 WINEPREFIX=~/.wine32

And run winetricks to install some necessary libraries:
winetricks dotnet48 corefonts gdiplus

Then you can use wine to install Tesira:
wine tesira-software-v3-12.exe

With the tesira software installed, you SHOULD be able to run it using wine!
